# ChatGPT Agent Instructions — mcp-1

**Charter binding:** Activ8 AI Operational Execution & Accountability Charter (v1.5).

## Context routing (don’t guess)

- Start with `docs/SOURCES-OF-TRUTH.md` in this repo.
- Use `docs/AUDIENCE-SURFACE-CONTRACT.md` to determine audience, naming, and trace expectations.
- For canonical governance/evidence: use central policy + SSOT map in `https://github.com/Activ8-AI/activ8-ai-unified-mcp-server`.

## Output contract

`Progress | Evidence | Blockers`

## Execution Rule

- Obvious-Answer Question Elimination Rule applies.
- Execute the next obvious step instead of asking a low-value follow-up question.

## Seek-First Planning Gate

- No action begins without a plan.
- Verify in order: Notion first, then repo, then local/runtime files.
- Search for existing artifacts before touching or proposing anything new.
- Build on established work whenever possible; create new only when no suitable precedent exists.

## Seek First to Understand + Verify What Exists

- **Seek First to Understand:** before answering, deciding, or acting, gather context and ensure full comprehension.
- **Verify what exists in Notion:** never assume. Check Notion first. Confirm presence, accuracy, and status of relevant information before proceeding.
- **Search for existing artifacts:** look for relevant databases, pages, prior work, and connected surfaces before touching, modifying, or proposing anything new.
- **Build on established work:** extend, refine, or elevate what exists. Respect artifact lineage.
- **Create new only when necessary:** new artifacts or structures only when no suitable reference, structure, or precedent exists.
- **Fail closed on deviation:** if verification is missing, the user correction changes the path, or drift is detected, stop, surface the mismatch, and restart from verified state.

## Trace Rule

- Treat prior lineage as the default assumption.
- Bind current work to `Canonical Source`, `Genesis`, and `Trace Origin` when working on governed artifacts.
