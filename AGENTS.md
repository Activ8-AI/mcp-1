# AGENTS.md — mcp-1

**Charter binding:** Activ8 AI Operational Execution & Accountability Charter (v1.5).

## Source of truth

- Local routing map: `docs/SOURCES-OF-TRUTH.md`
- Local audience + surface contract: `docs/AUDIENCE-SURFACE-CONTRACT.md`
- Central canonical policy: `https://github.com/Activ8-AI/activ8-ai-unified-mcp-server` at `.github/ai-agent-policy.md`

## Output contract

`Progress | Evidence | Blockers`

## Obvious-Answer Question Elimination Rule

- Do not ask for confirmation when the requested action is already clear.
- Execute the next obvious step and present the result.

## Seek-First Planning Gate

- No action begins without a plan.
- Verify in order: Notion first, then repo, then local/runtime files.
- Search for existing artifacts before touching or proposing anything new.
- Build on lineage before create-new.

## Seek First to Understand + Verify What Exists

- **Seek First to Understand:** before answering, deciding, or acting, gather context and ensure full comprehension.
- **Verify what exists in Notion:** never assume. Check Notion first. Confirm presence, accuracy, and status of relevant information before proceeding.
- **Search for existing artifacts:** look for relevant databases, pages, prior work, and connected surfaces before touching, modifying, or proposing anything new.
- **Build on established work:** extend, refine, or elevate what exists. Respect artifact lineage.
- **Create new only when necessary:** new artifacts or structures only when no suitable reference, structure, or precedent exists.
- **Fail closed on deviation:** if verification is missing, the user correction changes the path, or drift is detected, stop, surface the mismatch, and restart from verified state.

## Managed Repo Operationalization

- Run `npm run operationalize:repo -- --dry-run` in preflight paths.
- Keep `.github/workflows/build-operationalization.yml` present and green.
- Keep prompt assets in `artifacts/prompt-library/` aligned to the central control plane.

## Automatic Source Bootstrap

- Run `npm run session:boot` at session start when the brief is missing or stale.
- Reuse `memory/session-brief.md` and the receipts under `artifacts/source-query-ladder/` before broadening into fresh live workspace search.
- Treat missing `scripts/session-boot.mjs` or `scripts/query-source-ladder.mjs` as a contract failure, not a convenience gap.

## Trace + Audience Contract

- Treat prior lineage as the default, not the exception.
- Before classifying work as net-new, search for earlier mention, precursor language, adjacent framing, and codification.
- Use `docs/AUDIENCE-SURFACE-CONTRACT.md` to classify the surface you are touching and bind:
  `Audience`, `Surface Type`, `Canonical Source`, `Genesis`, and `Trace Origin`.
